# Lootbox Hacker News Tracker - Session Log

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Project:** Building a persistent Hacker News reading tracker using lootbox

---

## Overview

Created a Hacker News reading tracker that fetches the top 10 stories, tracks which ones have been read, and persists the data between runs using lootbox's key-value store.

---

## Step 1: Explored Lootbox Capabilities

### Command: `lootbox --help`

**Key findings:**

- Lootbox is a sandboxed TypeScript runtime with network access
- Network-only sandbox (no file system access)
- 10-second execution timeout
- Provides `tools` object for accessing function namespaces
- Supports `fetch()` for HTTP requests

---

## Step 2: Discovered Available Namespaces

### Command: `lootbox --namespaces`

**Result:**

```json
{
  "rpc": ["fs", "kv", "sqlite"],
  "mcp": []
}
```

Identified `kv` (key-value store) as the ideal solution for persistent storage.

---

## Step 3: Examined KV Store API

### Command: `lootbox --types kv`

**Key functions identified:**

- `tools.kv.get({ key: string })` - Retrieve values
- `tools.kv.set({ key: string, value: unknown })` - Store values
- `tools.kv.list()`, `tools.kv.delete()`, etc.

---

## Step 4: Created HN Tracker Script

**File:** `hn-tracker.ts`

### Features:

1. **Fetches top 10 Hacker News stories** via HN Firebase API
2. **Tracks read stories** using `tools.kv` with key `hn:read_stories`
3. **Displays categorized results:**
   - ðŸ†• New stories (not yet read)
   - âœ“ Already read stories
4. **Demo behavior:** Marks first 3 unread stories as read on each run

### Key Implementation Details:

- Uses parallel Promise.all for efficient story fetching
- Stores story IDs as array in KV store
- Filters stories into new vs. already-read categories
- Displays rich metadata: author, score, URL

---

## Step 5: First Execution - Initial Run

### Command: `lootbox hn-tracker.ts`

**Results:**

- **Total stories in DB:** 0
- **Action:** Marked first 3 stories as read
- **Output:** All 10 stories shown as "NEW"
- **Summary:** 10 new, 0 already read

**Stories tracked (first 3):**

1. Germany must stand firmly against client-side scanning in Chat Control [pdf]
2. The Collapse of the Econ PhD Job Market
3. Litestream v0.5.0

---

## Step 6: Second Execution - Persistence Verification

### Command: `lootbox hn-tracker.ts`

**Results:**

- **Total stories in DB:** 3
- **Action:** Marked 3 more stories as read
- **Output:**
  - 7 stories shown as "NEW"
  - 3 stories shown as "ALREADY READ"
- **Summary:** 7 new, 3 already read

âœ… **Persistence confirmed!** The KV store successfully retained data between runs.

---

## Conclusions

### What Works

âœ… Fetch API for external HTTP requests
âœ… RPC tools (kv, sqlite, fs) for data persistence
âœ… TypeScript execution with type safety
âœ… Promise.all for parallel operations
âœ… Data persistence between script executions

### Use Case Validation

The Hacker News tracker successfully demonstrates:

- External API integration (HN Firebase API)
- Persistent state management (KV store)
- Practical utility (track reading progress)

---

## Files Created

- **hn-tracker.ts** - Hacker News reading tracker script (167 lines)
- **lootbox-hn-tracker-session.md** - This session log

---

## Usage Instructions

To run the tracker:

```bash
lootbox hn-tracker.ts
```

The script will:

1. Fetch current top 10 HN stories
2. Compare against your reading history
3. Show which stories are new vs. already read
4. Mark first 3 unread stories as read (demo mode)

Run multiple times to see persistence in action!
